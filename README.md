<h1 align="center">COVID-19 Desktop Application</h1>

## Why?
As soon I saw someone posted web application for this covid-19, I search/research if someone already created an a desktop application for covid-19 tracker since I don't see any app. I decided to create and make it simple. [Fixing Installer/Setup]()
